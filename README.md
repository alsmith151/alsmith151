## Research Focus

My research investigates the emergence and function of novel enhancers in leukaemia, with a particular focus on **MLL-AF4 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL)**. I use a combination of **experimental and computational approaches** to study the interplay between chromatin architecture and transcriptional dysregulation in cancer.

My work integrates multiple high-throughput assays including:

- **Epigenomic profiling**: ChIP-seq, low-input ChIPmentation, ATAC-seq, CUT&Tag  
- **Transcriptomics**: RNA-seq, single-cell multiome  
- **Chromatin conformation**: NG Capture-C, Tiled-C  
- **Epigenetic modification**: DNA methylation profiling  

These datasets are analysed using custom bioinformatic pipelines, statistical modelling, and machine learning to uncover regulatory mechanisms driving leukaemogenesis.

## Software & Tools

I develop open-source tools to support the analysis of functional genomics data, with an emphasis on reproducibility, performance, and accessibility.
